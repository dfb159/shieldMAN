# SHIELD


## Installation

```sh
poerty install
poetry shell
```




## Testing and Training

Currently, training/testing fighters works through the fighter tests.
```sh
python tests/test_dqn_fighter.py
```

## Tensorboard

```sh
tensorboard --logdir log/ --load_fast=false
```


## Limitations

Currently, the implementation through `tianshou.BasePolicy` seems to only support DQNPolicy and also not `Discrete()` observation spaces.
